# Hypermedia Applications
gruppo: Lucia Polidori, Gerlando Savio Scibetta

* We built ourselves the template for our website using the Bootstrap framework, and applying a few customizations to it.

* The **PhoneGap** build obtained from https://build.phonegap.com/ is **fully functioning**, please take the time to try it out.

* All the links included in the website are working, and time was taken to fill the database to an adequate amount so as to give a realistic feeling of navigating through the website. 
An exception to this is the link for the category of *Salute and Benessere* under *Smartlife*, the reason is that it contained a serious inconsistency with our 
design w.r.t. the real TIM website (it contained products not services!)

* We included a fully functional **Filter** for the product and assistance pages (where applicable).

* To make the website more **usable** (especially in the mobile) we included a button that sends the user back to the top of the page after it scrolls down a certain amount. 

* All the "SPECIALS" (optional) forms were implemented, altough they do nothing in practice.

### Improvements from Design Project
We addressed both issues that were noted in the first evaluation (Link "torna" inconsistente, orientation info minimali) this way: 
  * We kept the highlight in the navbar of the topic of the current page
  * We removed the go-back link and substitued it with buttons that resemble "breadcrumbs"
  * and also we **color coded** our webpages by a Multiple Topic criterion (Product pages are **blue**, SL **orange** and Assistance **green**) so that it's very easy for the user to get a sense of change of topic when navigatin through the website.
