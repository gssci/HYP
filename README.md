# Hypermedia Applications
gruppo: Lucia Polidori, Gerlando Savio Scibetta

* We built ourselves the template for our website using the Bootstrap framework, and applying to it a few customizations.

* The **PhoneGap** build obtained from https://build.phonegap.com/ is **fully functioning** and with an icon, please take the time to try it out.

* All the links included in the website are working, and time was taken to fill the database to an adequate amount so as to give a realistic feeling of navigating through the website. 
An exception to this is the link for the category of *Salute and Benessere* under *Smartlife*, the reason is that it contained a serious inconsistency with our 
design w.r.t. the TIM website (it contained products not services!)

* We included a fully functional **Filter** for the product and assistance pages.

* To make the website more **usable** (especially in the mobile) we included a button that sends the user back to the top of the page after it scrolls down a certain amount. 

* All the "SPECIALS" (optional) forms were implemented, altough they do nothing in practice.
